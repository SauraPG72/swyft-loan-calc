## 🎯 **Next Steps for Verification**

### **1. Bank Calculator Cross-Reference**
Test these exact values on bank websites:
- **ANZ Personal Loan Calculator**
- **CBA Loan Calculator**
- **Westpac Personal Loan Calculator**

**Test Case:**
```
Loan Amount: $30,000
Interest Rate: 7.5% p.a.
Term: 5 years
Frequency: Monthly
Expected Payment: ~$601.14
```

### **2. Excel Verification**
```excel
=PMT(7.5%/12, 60, -30000)
Expected Result: $601.14
```

### **3. Financial Calculator**
Use HP 12C or similar:
```
30000 PV
7.5 g i
60 n
PMT
Expected: $601.14
```
